Dirk Brockmann is Professor at the Institute of Biology at Humboldt-University of Berlin. Between 2007-2013 he was Professor for Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University. At Northwestern University he was on the faculty of [Northwestern's Institute on Complex Systems](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/) where he still holds an external faculty position.

A theoretical physicist by training, his research focuses on complex systems at the interface of physics, life sciences and social sciences. He is particularly interested the application of dynamicals systems theory, stochastic processes and network science to infectious disease dynamics and related contagion processes. In this context he is currently investigating dynamical processes on time-dependent networks, complex contagion processes and the emergence of cooperation in evolutionary processes. He is known for his work on human mobility and its role on the global spread of infectious diseases.

Dirk Brockmann is member of the [Institute of Theoretical Biology](https://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/wiki/) as well as the [Integrated Research Institute for
the Life-Sciences](https://www.iri-ls.hu-berlin.de/en) at Humboldt University of Berlin.

He is also head of the project group [Computational Epidemiology at the Robert Koch-Institute](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Forsch/Projektgruppen/Projektgruppe_4/P4_node.html), Germany's federal public health institute.

In 2017 he launched the project [Complexity Explorables](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/), a collection of interactive illustration on complex systems that continously expands in examples and is designed for teachers, instructors and people that want to gain an intuitive unterstanding of the beauty of complex dynamical processes in nature.
