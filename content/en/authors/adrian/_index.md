Adrian Zachariae is a PhD student at ROCS. During the chaotic times of COVID-19 he also contributes to various projects outside of the scope of his PhD including the Mobility Monitor and Datenspende. While he is experienced in many traditional data science tropes like time-series and geospatial analysis, his true passion is how small things and rules can come together to produce magnificent dynamics and structures.
