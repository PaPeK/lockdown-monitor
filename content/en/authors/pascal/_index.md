Pascal analyzes mobility, contact networks and flight network data in the context of infectious diseases and how societal interventions influence them. He has a general interest in emergent phenomena, i.e., how macroscopic patterns emerge from microscopic interactions/behaviors.
His previous work was on the topics of opinion dynamics on networks, tipping points, collective behavior, and evolutionary processes. He joined our team during the Corona Pandemic in March 2021.

Pascal studied physics and received his PhD in theoretical biophysics, analyzing patterns of movement and behavior.
