Ben is a postdoctoral researcher mainly studying how human behavior influences the spread of infectious diseases, but with widespread interest and experience regarding complex systems, network theory, data science, educational outreach, and algorithmic arts. Having a background in physics, he's trained in analyzing and visualizing big data sets as well as searching for the fundamental mechanisms that shape a systemâ€™s behavior. In the group, he leads own research projects, co-coordinates others, and supervises students. In case the figurative excrements hit the fan he doesn't hesitate to get his hands dirty either.
