In addition to mobility and contacts, we are now looking at the **worldwide air transportation network** and how the new **Omicron** variant might spread across it.

While the local _mobility_ of people and their _contacts_ help us understand how infection events change in Germany, for the **global spread of a new variant, the flight network is crucial**.

In the new [**flight network analysis**](/reports/importrisk_omicron), we build on an earlier study [Brockmann et al.](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1245200) to give a probability of a country importing the new variant from South Africa and Botswana.

The variant has already reached 11 other countries, some of which do not have a direct flight connection to South Africa and Botswana. With a special focus on Europe, we also present the most **threatened European airports**.
