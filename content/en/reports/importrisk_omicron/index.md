### Relative import risk

By looking at air travel passenger numbers, we can estimate how likely it is that the virus spreads to other areas. The busier a flight route, the more probable it is that an infected passenger travels this route. Using these probabilistic concepts, we calculate the **relative import risk** to other airports. When calculating the import risk, we also take into account connecting flights and travel routes that involve multiple destintions.

Current import risk for the Omicron variant estimates for the top 50 countries (excluding South Africa and Botswana) at highest risk of importation. **Hover over a country** to display in the inset the relative import risk of the top airports in the selected country. The national import risk is the cumulative import risk of all airports in that country. A more extensive explanation of the analysis is provided in the **[Import Risk Analysis]()** section.
